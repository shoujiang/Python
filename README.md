Stock Data Analysis and Prediction with Python.ipynb.

Stock price prediction is one of the most difficult issue. The stock market is affected by economics, policies, details of company operations, industry trends, market information and psychological emotions. Stock data is time series, and traditional machine learning models and time series models can make predictions, such as linear regression, K-nearest neighbor, and ARIMA models. However, the performance of predictions is not satisfactory. In recent years, deep learning has been able to fit a lot of data. Therefore, we also used the simplest LSTM model to make predictions. By comparing several methods, it is found that deep learning models can obtain better performance.
